# RobotRadar

The goal of this project is to design and implement a radar application for GoPiGo robots that detects and displays obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.

## Features

1. **Obstacle Detection:** The GoPiGo robots are equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in their path.

2. **User Interface:** Detected obstacles are displayed on a user-friendly interface.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** The project includes thorough and up-to-date documentation that follows the IEEE documentation standards. A Quality Management Plan (QMP) is also provided along with detailed test cases to ensure the software meets its specifications and is easy to understand and maintain.

## Deployment Guide

1. Clone the repository into GoPiGo.
2. Import the pygame and gopigo libraries.
3. Run GoPiGo.
4. Execute main.py.
